			Aww, look at daddy's baby girl<br>
			That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head<br>
			Yesterday I changed your diaper<br>
			Wiped you and powdered you<br>
			How did you get so big?<br>
			Can't believe it, now you're two<br>
			Baby, you're so precious<br>
			Daddy's so proud of you<br>
			Sit down, bitch! You move again<br>
			I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)<br><br>
			Don't make me wake this baby!<br>
			She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!<br>
			Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!<br>
			How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!<br>
			Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?!<br>
			Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!<br>
			At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!"<br>
			But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!<br>
			This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!<br>
			How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!<br>
			Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!<br>
			He ain't so hot now, is he, little punk?!<br>
			(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!<br>
			You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!<br>
			Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!<br>
			(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)<br>
			We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk!<br><br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br><br>
			You really fucked me, Kim! You really did a number on me!<br>
			Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me<br>
			But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen<br>
			That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean<br>
			That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'<br>
			(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!<br>
			I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)<br>
			There's a -year-old little <br>
			Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!<br>
			Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!<br>
			You loved him, didn't you? (No!)<br>
			Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me!<br>
			What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?<br>
			Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!<br>
			Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me?<br>
			You think I'm ugly, don't you? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly<br>
			(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!<br>
			I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!<br>
			Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!<br>
			(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!<br><br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br><br>
			Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)<br>
			I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair!<br>
			Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!<br>
			Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!) Fuck you!<br>
			You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!<br>
			Oh my God, I'm crackin' up, get a grip, Marshall!<br>
			Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party<br>
			And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?<br>
			That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)<br>
			That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)<br>
			See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?<br>
			You and your husband have a fight<br>
			One of you tries to grab a knife<br>
			And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)<br>
			And while this is going on, his son just woke up<br>
			And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut<br>
			(Oh my God!) So now they both dead<br>
			And you slash your own throat<br>
			So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note<br>
			I shoulda known better when you started to act weird<br>
			We couldaâ€” hey, where you going? Get back here!<br>
			You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else<br>
			You're only makin' this harder on yourself!<br>
			Ha-ha, got ya! Go ahead, yell!<br>
			Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah, somebody help!"<br>
			Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!<br>
			Now shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you!<br>
			You were supposed to love me!<br>
			Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!<br><br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br>
			So long, bitch, you did me so wrong<br>
			I don't wanna go on<br>
			Living in this world without you<br><br>
