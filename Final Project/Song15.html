			When passion's lost and all the trust is gone,<br>
			Way too far, for way too long<br>
			Children crying, cast out and neglected,<br>
			Only in a world so cold, only in a world<br>
			This cold<br>
			Hold the hand of your best friend, look into their eyes<br>
			Then watch them drift away<br>
			Some might say, we've done the wrong things,<br>
			For way too long, for way too long<br><br>

			Fever inside the storm,<br>
			So I'm turning away.<br>
			Away from the name <br>
			(Calling your names)<br>
			Away from the stones <br>
			(Throw sticks and stones)<br>
			'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us<br><br>

			Keep your thorns<br>
			'Cause I'm running away,<br>
			Away from the games<br>
			(Fucking head games)<br>
			Away from the space<br>
			(Hate this head space)<br>
			The circumstances of a world so cold<br>

			burning whispers, Remind me of the days,<br>
			I was left alone, in a world this cold<br>
			Guilty of the same things, provoked by<br>
			The cause,<br>
			I've left alone, in a world so cold<br>
			Fever inside the storm,<br>
			So I'm turning away.<br>
			Away from the name <br>
			(Calling your names)<br>
			Away from the stones <br>
			(Throw sticks and stones)<br>
			'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us<br><br>

			Keep your thorns<br>
			'Cause I'm running away,<br>
			Away from the games<br>
			(Fucking head games)<br>
			Away from the space<br>
			(Hate this head space)<br>
			The circumstances of a world so cold<br><br>

			I'm flying, I'm flying away,<br>
			Away from the names<br>
			(Calling your names)<br>
			Away from the games <br>
			(Fucking head games)<br> 
			The circumstances of a world so cold<br><br>

			Why does everyone feel like my enemy,<br>
			Don't want any part of depression or<br>
			Darkness, I've had enough<br>
			sick and tired, bring the sun, or I'm gone,<br>
			Or I'm gone<br><br>

			I'm backing out, I'm no pawn,<br>
			No mother-fucking slave to this,<br>
			Never lied<br>
			Never left<br>
			Never lived<br>
			Never loved<br>
			Never lost<br>
			Never hurt<br>
			Never worry about being me, or anyone else<br>
			Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about<br>
			Anything<br><br>

			Backing out, giving up, no mother-fucking <br>
			Slave to this,<br>
			Never lied<br>
			Never left<br>
			Never lived<br>
			Never loved<br>
			Never lost<br>
			Never hurt<br>
			Never worry about being me, or anyone else<br>
			Not a care, no concern, don't give a shit about <br>
			Anything, <br><br>

			I need to find a darkened corner,<br>
			A lightless corner,<br>
			Where it's safer and calmer,<br><br>

			I'm turning away.<br>
			Away from the name <br>
			(Calling your names)<br>
			Away from the stones <br>
			(Throw sticks and stones)<br>
			'Cause I'm through mending the wounds of us<br><br>

			I'm running away,<br>
			Away from the games<br>
			(Fucking head games)<br>
			Away from the space<br>
			(Hate this head space)<br>
			The circumstances of a world so cold<br><br>

			I'm flying, I'm flying away,<br>
			Away from the names<br>
			(Calling your names)<br>
			Away from the games <br>
			(Fucking head games)<br>
			The circumstances of a world so cold<br>
