			It's true that sometimes intuition ties the blinding folds<br>
			To contemplate not what, but why the way the mind will go<br>
			Sometimes it plays the heart, it's so lovely at the start<br>
			But when the walls come crashing down I take it all apart<br>
			Arise my jaded cynicism, analyzing criticism<br>
			Every thought so skeptical, no mysteries are left at all<br>
			No silly romance fantasies are really how they're hoped to be<br>
			No this is not a song of love, just so damn reminiscent of it all<br><br>

			Whoow, intention. When you leave these things behind, I can't open up my mind at all<br>
			Whoow, intention. Well I know, I know that love ain't real but I can't deny the way I feel<br>
			I'd like to say I'll find the day when no more will I feel this way, and if I never, very well. But only tests of time can tell<br>
			Indulge the moment and then it's gone, but never for too very long<br>
			No this is not a song of love just so damn reminiscent of it all<br><br>

			The fight to strive, genetic drive, those early days of man. Replication and survive, to act not understand<br>
			For every lost potential mother kills you from within, for fear of life's own preservation starts to settle in<br>
			Well I know it gets confusing and I know it's worth a try<br>
			When instinct tells you how to act but just won't tell you why<br>
			And as single souls are drawn together, passionate and blind<br>
			Just keep this simple thought in mind, that love is just a concept for the times<br><br>

			Whoow, intention. When you leave these things behind, I can't open up my mind at all<br>
			Whoow, intention. Well I know, I know that love ain't real but I can't deny the way I feel<br>
			I'd like to say I'll find the day when no more will I feel this way, and if I never, very well. But only tests of time can tell<br>
			Indulge the moment and then it's gone, but never for too very long<br>
			No this is not a song of love just so damn reminiscent of it all<br><br>

			Woe and blight, such is life. Though excel for all is well<br>
			Woe and blight, such is life. Though excel for all is well<br><br>

			Whoow, intention. When you leave these things behind, I can't open up my mind at all<br>
			Whoow, intention. Oh no this is not a song of love just so damn reminiscent of it all<br><br>
