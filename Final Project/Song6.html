			I'll never know what brought me here,<br>
			As if somebody led my hand,<br>
			It seems I hardly had to steer,<br>
			My course was planned.<br>
			And destiny it guides us all,<br>
			And by it's hand we rise and fall,<br>
			But only for a moment,<br>
			Time enough to catch our breath again.<br><br>

			And we're just another piece of the puzzle,<br>
			Just another part of the plan,<br>
			How one live touches the other,<br>
			Is so hard to understand.<br>
			Still we walk this road together,<br>
			We travel through as far as we can,<br>
			And we have waited for this moment in time,<br>
			Ever since the world began.<br><br>

			Taking in the times gone by,<br>
			We wonder how it all began,<br>
			We'll never know and still we<br>
			Try to understand.<br>
			And even though the seasons change,<br>
			The reasons shall remain the same,<br>
			It's love that keeps us holding on<br>
			Till we can see the sun again.<br><br>

			And we're just another piece of the puzzle,<br>
			Just another part of the plan,<br>
			And we have waited for this moment in time,<br>
			Ever since the world began.<br><br>

			And I stand alone, a man of stone,<br>
			Against the driving rain,<br>
			And the night it's got your number,<br>
			And the wind it cries your name,<br>
			If we search for truth, win or lose,<br>
			In this we're all the same,<br>
			The hope still burns eternal,<br>
			We're the keeper of the flame.<br><br>

			And we're just another piece of the puzzle,<br>
			Just another part of the plan,<br>
			How one live touches the other,<br>
			Is so hard to understand.<br>
			Still we walk this road together,<br>
			We try and go as far as we can,<br>
			And we have waited for this moment in time,<br>
			Ever since the world began.<br><br>
