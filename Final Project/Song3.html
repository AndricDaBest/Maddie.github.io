			Girl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?<br>
			If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson<br><br>

			Now would you hate me if I said goodbye<br>
			So quick you could eat my dust?<br>
			Now would you hate me if I ran like hell<br>
			In the wind from dawn til' dusk?<br><br>

			When you cry, you waste your time<br>
			Over boys you never liked<br>
			Can you not be so obvious<br>
			So keep it light<br>
			So keep it light, no<br><br>

			I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen<br>
			I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent<br>
			I don't wanna die so young<br>
			I got so much to do<br>
			I don't smile for the camera<br>
			Only smile for you<br>
			Smile for you<br><br>

			Now would you hate me if I said goodbye<br>
			So quick you could eat my dust?<br>
			Now would you hate me if I ran like hell<br>
			In the wind from dawn til' dusk?<br><br>

			When you cry, you waste your time<br>
			Over boys you never liked<br>
			Can you not?<br><br>
