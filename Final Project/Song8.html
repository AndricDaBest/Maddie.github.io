			And now I don't know why<br>
			She wouldn't say goodbye<br>
			But then it seems that I<br>
			Had seen it in her eyes<br><br>

			Though it might not be wise<br>
			I'd still have to try<br>
			With all the love<br>
			I have inside<br>
			I can't deny<br><br>

			I just can't let it die<br>
			Cause her heart's just like mine<br>
			And she holds her pain inside<br><br>

			So if you ask me why<br>
			She wouldn't say goodbye<br>
			I know somewhere inside<br><br>

			There is a special light<br>
			Still shining bright<br>
			And even on the darkest night<br>
			She can't deny<br><br>

			So if she's somewhere near me<br>
			I hope to God she hears me<br>
			There's no one else<br>
			Could ever make me feel<br>
			I'm so alive<br>
			I hoped she'd never leave me<br>
			Please God you must believe me<br>
			I've searched the universe<br>
			And found myself<br>
			Within' her eyes<br><br>

			No matter how I try<br>
			They say it's all a lie<br>
			So what's the use of my confessions to a crime<br>
			Of passions that won't die<br>
			In my heart<br><br>

			So if she's somewhere near me<br>
			I hope to God she hears me<br>
			There's no one else<br>
			Could ever make me feel<br>
			I'm so alive<br><br>

			I hoped she'd never leave me<br>
			Please God you must believe me<br>
			I've searched the universe<br>
			And found myself<br>
			Within' her eyes<br><br>

			So if she's somewhere near me<br>
			I hope to God she hears me<br>
			There's no one else<br>
			Could ever make me feel<br>
			I'm so alive<br><br>

			I hoped she'd never leave me<br>
			Please God you must believe me<br>
			I've searched the universe<br>
			And found myself<br>
			Within' her eyes<br><br>

			So now I don't know why<br>
			She wouldn't say goodbye<br>
			It just might be that I<br>
			Had seen it in her eyes<br>
			And now it seems that I<br>
			Gave up my ghost of pride<br>
			I'll never say goodbye<br><br>
