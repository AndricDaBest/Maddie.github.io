			She was a fast machine she kept her motor clean<br>
			She was the best damn woman that I ever seen<br>
			She had the sightless eyes telling me no lies<br>
			Knocking me out with those American thighs<br>
			Taking more than her share<br>
			Had me fighting for air<br>
			She told me to come but I was already there<br>
			Cause the walls start shaking<br>
			The earth was quaking<br>
			My mind was aching<br>
			And we were making it<br>
			And you shook me all night long<br>
			Yeah you shook me all night long<br><br>

			I'm working double time on the seduction line<br>
			She's one of a kind she's just mine all mine<br>
			Wanted no applause it's just another course<br>
			And come back for more<br>
			Had to cool me down to take another round<br>
			Now I'm back in the ring to take another swing<br>
			Cause the walls were shaking the earth was quaking<br>
			My mind was aching<br>
			And we were making it<br><br>

			And you shook me all night long<br>
			Yeah you shook me all night long<br>
			Knocked me out I said you<br>
			Shook me all night long<br>
			You had me shaking and you<br>
			Shook me all night long<br>
			Yeah you shook me<br>
			When you took me<br><br>

			You really took me and you<br>
			Shook me all night long<br>
			You shook me all night long<br>
			Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long<br>
			You really got me and you<br>
			Shook me all night long<br>
			Yeah you shook me<br>
			Yeah you shook me<br>
			All night long<br><br>
