			There I go, thinkin' of you again<br><br>
			You don't know how sick you make me<br>
			You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br>
			You must just not know<br>
			You may not think you do but you do<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br><br>
			I was gonna take the time to sit down<br>
			And write you a little poem<br>
			But off of the dome it would probably be a little more<br>
			More suitable for this type of song, whoa<br>
			I got a million reasons off the top of my head<br>
			That I could think of<br>
			Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to<br>
			So fuck it I'm a start right here and just be brief<br>
			About to rattle off some other reasons<br>
			I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo<br>
			Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?<br>
			I go and get another one, now I got two, ooh<br>
			Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin<br>
			I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again<br>
			My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shit<br>
			If you only knew how much I hated you<br>
			For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through<br>
			Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you, boohoo<br><br>
			You don't know how sick you make me<br>
			You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br>
			You must just not know<br>
			You may not think you do but you do<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br>
			I was gonna take the time to sit down<br>
			And write you a little letter<br>
			But I thought a song would probably be a little better<br>
			Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up, yeah<br>
			I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of<br>
			How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to<br>
			A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how<br>
			Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle<br>
			You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die<br>
			I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye<br>
			I hate your fuckin' guts you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die<br>
			But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad<br>
			It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back<br>
			It's just that when I think of you it makes me want to yack, ack<br>
			But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue<br>
			Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to<br>
			But every time I think of you now all I want to do is puke<br><br>
			You don't know how sick you make me<br>
			You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br>
			You must just not know<br>
			You may not think you do but you do<br>
			Every time I think of you I puke<br><br>
