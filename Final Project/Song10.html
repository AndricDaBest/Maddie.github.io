			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			I touched a willy in high school once<br>
			And it was just a little mistake<br>
			So please stop calling me gay<br><br>

			I swear I love vagina<br>
			And I love to touch that pussy<br>
			I kissed two girls before and it felt really good<br>
			Because they were women and not men<br>
			'Cause I'm not gay<br>
			Penises are for faggots<br>
			Penises are for gays<br>
			Penises are disgusting<br>
			So please stop calling me gay<br>
			I love to have sex<br>
			With women with big breasts<br>
			I don't have sex with men<br>
			'Cause if I did that would make me gay<br>
			(Yeah)<br>
			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			You are hurting my feelings<br>
			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			Let me make this clear cause I do not lick willys<br>
			I went to summer camp and I touched a girl's boob<br>
			'Cause I'm not gay<br>
			See me licking that pussy<br>
			It feels really good and it feels really gooshy<br>
			I do not have proof but I swear I've touched a pussy<br>
			I like to have sex with cunts<br>
			I like to have sex with slits<br>
			I like to have sex with coin slots<br>
			Not fucking dicks<br>
			If I had sex with a dick<br>
			That would make your point valid<br>
			But I love fucking that pussy<br>
			And I'm not a faggot<br>
			So please stop calling me gay<br>
			So please stop calling me gay<br>
			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			Please stop calling me gay<br><br>

			Please stop calling me gay<br>
			I touched a willy in high school once<br>
			And it was just a little mistake<br>
			So please stop calling me gay<br><br>
