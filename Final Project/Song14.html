			Robert's got a quick hand<br>
			He'll look around the room<br>
			He won't tell you his plan<br>
			He's got a rolled cigarette<br>
			Hanging out his mouth<br>
			He's a cowboy kid<br><br>

			Yeah he found a six-shooter gun<br>
			In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things<br>
			I don't even know what<br>
			But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you<br><br>

			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, outrun my gun<br>
			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, faster than my bullet<br><br>

			Daddy works a long day<br>
			He be coming home late, and he's coming home late<br>
			And he's bringing me a surprise<br>
			'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice<br><br>

			I've waited for a long time<br>
			Yeah the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger<br>
			I reason with my cigarette<br>
			Then say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?"<br><br>

			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, outrun my gun<br>
			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, faster than my bullet<br><br>

			Run, run, run, run, ru-ru-ru-run, run, run<br>
			Ru-ru-ru-run, run, run, run<br>
			Ru-ru-ru-run, run, run, run, run, run<br><br>

			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, outrun my gun<br>
			All the other kids with the pumped up kicks<br>
			You better run, better run, faster than my bullet<br><br>
