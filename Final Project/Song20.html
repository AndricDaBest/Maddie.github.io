			Late night my shoes are worn, in a diner its 2 in the morn<br>
			And I wonder what will I do tonight<br>
			Cup of coffee and a cigarette more, clock above me reads 2: 04<br><br>


			And the nightowls all got a story to tell<br>
			The girl with the short hairs parents won't speak to me no more<br>
			They call her an unholy dyke and they call her a whore (oh well)<br>
			Order a bagel, butter and all, think to myself as i stare at the wall killin time, counting the change in my hand<br>
			Dark man sits on my right, shades keeping his eyes out of light<br>
			Drinks his coffee just as black as his skin<br>
			The man with the pack and the black hat sits in the back<br>
			His white eyes glow (like a fire burns bright in the act)<br><br>

			"WHOOOW" and the fat man comes in with little hair<br>
			His wife is unfaithful but he doesn't care as long as he can hold her tight at night<br>
			"YEAH" and the waitress Julie is a poet now, she writes her stories on a paper towel<br>
			To publish them someday she says she might<br>
			And the man in the back with the black hat stands and he grins<br>
			The first word he says all night is 'let the show begin'<br><br>

			Julie wants to have some fun so she takes a butter knife and cuts<br>
			Her fingers off one by one to find a problem now she tries to start on the next hand<br>
			Yea, and the fat man strips down the whore she cries to herself and<br>
			Defecates on the floor, i don't think i want the second half of my bagel no more<br>
			The fat man started to say how he wants to kill his wife<br>
			As the dyke cuts off his tongue with a jagged knife<br><br>

			And the two are making passionate love<br>
			And the dark blind man think she's seen enough<br>
			So he takes JulieÂ´s pen from her right hand<br>
			And he stabs his eyes as according to plan<br>
			Cause the man in the back simple laughs and he smiles<br>
			And the blood spills out on linoleum tile<br>
			And the fat man starts to eat the flesh of the whore<br>
			Yea the moods a little different than a minute before<br><br>
