			You give your hand to me<br>
			And then you say hello<br>
			And I can hardly speak<br>
			My heart is beating so<br>
			And anyone can tell<br>
			You think you know me well<br>
			Well, you don't know me<br><br>

			No, you don't know the one<br>
			Who dreams of you at night<br>
			And longs to kiss your lips<br>
			And longs to hold you tight<br>
			Oh I'm just a friend<br>
			That's all I've ever been<br>
			'Cause you don't know me<br><br>

			For I never knew<br>
			The art of making love<br>
			Though my heart aches<br>
			With love for you<br>
			Afraid and shy<br>
			I let my chance go by<br>
			A chance that you might love me, too<br><br>

			You give your hand to me<br>
			And then you say good-bye<br>
			I watch you walk away<br>
			Beside the lucky guy<br>
			Oh, you never know<br>
			The one who loves you so<br>
			Well, you don't know me<br><br>

			For I never knew<br>
			The art of making love<br>
			Though my heart aches<br>
			With love for you<br>
			Afraid and shy<br>
			I let my chance go by<br>
			A chance that you might love me, too<br><br>

			You give your hand to me,<br>
			And then you say good-bye<br>
			I watch you walk away<br>
			Beside the lucky guy<br>
			Oh, you never know<br>
			The one who loves you so<br>
			You don't know me<br><br>

			You never know<br>
			The one who loves you so<br>
			Well, you don't know me<br><br>
