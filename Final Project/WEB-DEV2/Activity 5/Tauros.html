															break in the dominant areas of your life that she rules: love and money. One transit to look forward to is a Venus-Jupiter conjunction in Sagittarius at the end of January<br> 
															(and again at the end of November), especially for its easygoing energy. Everything seems to be just a little easier now, which is kind of nice.<br> 

															A four-month-long Jupiter retrograde cycle starting in early April will help give you much-needed time for philosophical reflection and spiritual introspection. Confronting<br> 
															your darker behaviors, instincts, and habits isn't easy, but the chance for growth and transformation is enormous if you do it.<br><br>

															There's a new moon in your sign at the start of May that will help launch new relationships and projects if you find a way to use its powerful potential. Anything you<br> 
															instigate now should be successful if you see it through. Delegating is always an option, but you're better off at least supervising the details as things progress.<br><br>

															Uranus enters your earthy sign in the beginning of March and turns retrograde in August. This isn't the easiest pairing because Uranus likes change and you like things to<br> 
															stay the same. Can you reach a middle ground? Yes, but you'll have to be willing to keep a much more open mind than usual. The Jupiter retrograde welcomes introspection and<br> 
															the opportunity to shift your energy inward, so take full advantage of your downtime.<br><br> 
															As per astrology, this year is going to be really exciting for you, as it is filled with a lot of astonishments and amazement. The Taurus 2019 horoscope says that this year<br> 
															will be very fruitful for you and your dear ones because there lies a great possibility for you to get promoted at your job or obtain some good amount of profit through your<br> 
															business. Furthermore, students may also get a chance to go abroad, to pursue their higher education which will mark as a good opportunity for them to grow and get some<br> 
															exposure. Ganesha predicts, that your family life and matters affiliated to love will also bloom like a beautiful flower in a garden. According to the Taurus horoscope 2019,<br>
															the year will be enjoyable, and you will be able to accomplish tasks related to your profession and some related to your personal ones, which were incomplete for some time<br> 
															now.<br><br>

															An important aspect that you can put emphasis on, this Taurus life 2019 is, setting up of priorities and working on them accordingly. This is the best time where you can do<br>
															some good planning and implement them in the most perfect manner to get the best out of yourself and the resources available to you. So, work hard, aim to give your hundred<br>
															percent and the rest will follow, says Ganesha. You may as well notice, that you will have a great bonding with people around you as predicted in Taurus yearly horoscope<br> 
															2019.<br><br></p>
