		<p class="Test"><img src="Cancer2.jpg" ALIGN="left"/>This is your year to own it, Cancer. If you feel like you haven't been in control of your own destiny, it's time to take back your power and show the world what you're<br> 
															capable of!<br><br>

															You may have retreated into your comfortable shell at the end of 2018, thanks to some bad experiences, unexpected news, or various other disappointments, so you aren't<br> 
															really interested in exposing your raw emotions to the world right now. Maybe you already put yourself out there on social media and got burned, or perhaps you've always<br> 
															been afraid to show how you really feel. You do feel things deeply, but right now you'd much rather keep your thoughts to yourself than put them out there for everyone to<br>
															see (and critique).<br><br>

															The full moon in January aims to shine a light on your soft spots, though, and the fact that it's a supermoon means there will be few places to hide. What kind of hand are<br>
															you capable of playing when your cards are unexpectedly exposed? You're about to find out.<br><br>

															You feel much less exposed and more confident when the sun spends time in your sign between the end of June and the end of July, especially since you enjoy the summer months<br> 
															and all they entail. You love getting together with friends and family for some sun and fun, and this could be the summer you have some very interesting romantic<br> 
															developments to look forward to.<br><br>

															Moody Pluto (in strict Capricorn) heads direct in autumn, hopefully putting to rest some of the suspicions you've had for the past several months. The year 2019 is all<br> 
															about taking control of your life, Cancer, and this is a great time to start.<br><br>
															Cancerians are usually very sentimental, sensitive and intuitive by nature, and your life as per 2019 Cancer horoscope may turn out to be really productive for them as<br> 
															matters related to finance, career and job is going to take a positive leap. Therefore, those who have a job will be appreciated and promoted, as your hard work and<br> 
															capabilities will lead you through the way and bestow you with the taste of success, confirms Ganesha. For all the businessmen, you may get good opportunities to make<br> 
															new clients or implement something new, which will be favorable and advantageous for you,<br> 
															monetarily.<br><br>

															You may also get a chance to enlarge and develop your business on a bigger scale and achieve a state of prosperity. The only thing that you have to make sure is to plan<br> 
															your moves and implement it accordingly which will assure your victory. As far as the subject related to love is concerned, two periods right from, January to March and<br> 
															October to December is the best time to involve yourself in a relationship. Those who intend to get married, will also find this the best suitable time to get into the<br> 
															association of marriage, as per Cancer 2019 horoscope.<br><br></p>
