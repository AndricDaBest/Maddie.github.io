		<h2 style="color:black;">Rise To Power</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">Discharged from the hospital amid the social chaos that followed Germany’s defeat, Hitler took up political work in Munich in May–June 1919. As an army political agent, 
		he joined the small German Workers’ Party in Munich (September 1919). In 1920 he was put in charge of the party’s propaganda and left the army to devote himself to 
		improving his position within the party, which in that year was renamed the National-sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (Nazi). Conditions were ripe for the development 
		of such a party. Resentment at the loss of the war and the severity of the peace terms added to the economic woes and brought widespread discontent. This was especially 
		sharp in Bavaria, due to its traditional separatism and the region’s popular dislike of the republican government in Berlin. In March 1920 a coup d’état by a few army 
		officers attempted in vain to establish a right-wing government. <a href="Art1.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Oradour-sur-Glane Massacre</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10 June, Diekmann's battalion sealed off Oradour-sur-Glane and ordered everyone within to assemble in the village square to have their identity papers examined. 
		This included six non-residents who happened to be bicycling through the town when the SS unit arrived. The women and children were locked in the church, and the 
		village was looted. The men were led to six barns and sheds, where machine guns were already in place. According to a survivor's account, the SS men then began shooting, aiming for their legs. When victims were unable to move, the SS men covered them with fuel and set the 
		barns on fire. Only six men managed to escape. One of them was later seen walking down a road and was shot dead. In all, 190 Frenchmen died. The SS men next proceeded to the church and placed an incendiary device beside it. When it was ignited, women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows,

		<h2 style="color:black;">Auschwitz II-Birkenau</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">The victories of Operation Barbarossa in the summer and fall of 1941 against Hitler's new enemy, the Soviet Union, led to dramatic changes in Nazi anti-Jewish ideology and the profile of prisoners brought to Auschwitz. 
		Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), intended the camp to house 50,000 prisoners of war, who 
		would be interned as forced laborers. Plans called for the expansion of the camp first to house 150,000 and eventually as many as 200,000 inmates. An initial contingent of 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at 
		Auschwitz I in October 1941, but by March 1942 only 945 were still alive, and these were transferred to Birkenau, where most of them died from disease or starvation by May. By this time the Nazis had decided to 
		annihilate the Jewish people, so Birkenau was changed to a labor camp–extermination camp. The Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum estimates that 1.3 million people, 1.1 million of them Jewish, were sent 
		to the camp during its existence.<a href="Art3.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Command and Control</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">Camp guards were members of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (Death's Head Units). Around 7,000 SS personnel in total were posted to Auschwitz during the war. Of 
		these, 4 percent of SS personnel were officers and 26 percent were non-commissioned officers, while the remainder were rank-and-file members. Approximately three 
		in four SS personnel worked in security. Others worked in the medical or political departments, in the camp headquarters, or in the economic administration, which was 
		responsible for the property of dead prisoners. SS personnel at the camp included 200 women, who worked as guards, nurses, or messengers. The overall command 
		authority for the entire camp was Department D (the Concentration Camps Inspectorate) of the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS Economics Main Office; SS-WVHA)..<a href="Art4.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Selection and extermination process</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">On 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written authorization to Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), to prepare and submit a plan for Die Endlösung der 
		Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question) in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of all involved government organizations.
		The resulting Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as 
		slave labor or to be murdered. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people 
		through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed 
		to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.<a href="Art5.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Nazi Human experimentation</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">German doctors performed a wide variety of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large 
		doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought 
		prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic 
		substances to study the effects.<a href="Art6.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Death toll</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">The exact number of victims at Auschwitz is difficult to fix with certainty, because many prisoners were never registered and much evidence was destroyed by the SS in the 
		final days of the war. As early as 1942, Himmler visited the camp and ordered that "all mass graves were to be opened and the corpses burned. In addition the ashes 
		were to be disposed of in such a way that it would be impossible at some future time to calculate the number of corpses burned."<a href="Art7.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Life in the camps</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">The prisoners' day began at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli describes roll call as beginning 3:00 am and lasting four hours. 
		The weather was cold in Auschwitz at that time of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, 
		when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to squat for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as 
		beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted.<a href="Art8.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Individual escape attempts</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">At least 802 prisoners attempted to escape from the Auschwitz camps, mostly Polish or Soviet prisoners fleeing from work sites outside the camp. 144 were successful. 
		The fates of 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes 
		arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block 
		and starved them to death.<a href="Art9.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>

		<h2 style="color:black;">Sonderkommando revolt</h2></p>
		<p style="color:black;">The Sonderkommando units were aware that as witnesses to the killings, they themselves would eventually be killed to hide Nazi crimes. Though they knew that it would 
		mean their deaths, the Sonderkommandos of Birkenau Kommando III staged an uprising on 7 October 1944, following an announcement that some of them would be selected to be 
		"transferred to another camp"—a common Nazi ruse for the murder of prisoners. The Sonderkommandos attacked the SS guards with stones, axes, and makeshift hand 
		grenades, which they also used to damage Crematorium IV and set it afire.<a href="Art10.html"><b>READ MORE</b></a><p><br><br><br><br>
