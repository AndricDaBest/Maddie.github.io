		<p style="color:black;">I am Andrico Sean Galeon and I am 19 years old. 
		My hobbies are collecting and playing games.<br>
		<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="1000">I usually spend my time at home and I'm not the "going out" type of person, Although </marquee> 
		<marquee direction="right" scrollamount="1000">whenever<br> my friends invites me to go drinking or just hangout I usually go along.</marquee>
		When it comes to video <br>games I don't have any self control, whenever a  certain game 
		is on sale I just impulsively buy it. Honestly I lost all my savings<br> to video games, but now
		that I'm broke; <marquee direction="right">I'm starting to get</marquee> rid of my bad habit. Watching TV series is one of my favourite
		thing<br> in the world, for it makes me calm. <marquee direction="left" scrollamount="1000">Whenever I get sad </marquee>all I have to do is distract myself
		from the <marquee direction="right" scrollamount="1000">problem and let my future self handle it.</marquee><br> I usually solve the problem by drinking alone, 
		because<marquee direction="right" scrollamount="1000"> once</marquee> in<marquee direction="right" scrollamount="400"> a</marquee> while<marquee direction="right" scrollamount="100"> everybody</marquee> needs to take the time and let our deep thoughts go nuts.<br><br>
		
		Back when I was in my first year of highschool, I was the runt of the class and often
		get picked on.<br> I always get back at the bullies by annoying them because let's be honest, 
		my midget size cannot take on the bullies.<br> There was a time where one of my classmate stood up 
		for me and fought the bullies, after that encounter we<br> hang out more often and became bestfriends. 
		Later on my friend circle grew and we decided to<br> play football just for fun. One day our PE teacher 
		saw us playing and she saw potential.<br> Our PE teacher sweet talked us int forming our own official 
		team, surprisingly we held our ground and won a few events.<br> That experience is one of my 
		precious memory, it was a thrilling,frustrating,sad,and fun.<br><br>
		
		Right now I live near Fuente Osmena, my real home is in Mindanao,Ozamiz City.<br> I started my college
		in the summer of March in Gardner University, I was a little scared because speaking tagalog<br> is not my 
		forte and I didn't have enough confidence back then so I was kind of a loner<br> for a year. My classmate 
		often invites me to lunch but I always declined their offer because I was too afraid that my grammar in<br> 
		Tagalog is a little off but what I observed was people doesn't care if your accent or grammar is a little 
		different and slowly but surely I gained confidence. <br>Me and my classmates really bonded when we were having 
		a tough time in programming, we always shared answers and<br> never bothered learning the flow of the code; Even 
		in Engineering Drawing sometimes we pay someone else to do the job. <br><br>
		
		My Mother transferred here in Cebu City because of her work, I simply went along because staying in Manila<br> 
		by myself is a little pricey. In the school year 2017-2018 I transferred here in Univeristy of Cebu<br> 
		because it's the only school that accepts transferees on that time of year, somehow Univeristy<br> 
		of Cebu exceeded my expectations. On my first day of school here It seems that I reverted<br> back to 
		my old shy self. A week later I still haven't met my professor, so I mustered my all<br> my courage 
		and asked the person next to me if we were in the right class.<br> After that moment I remembered that 
		people don't care and with that I gained my confidence back.<br><br>
		
		
		My plan right now is to finish BSIT and take short courses so that I can never forget java or html.<br>
		I'll work hard so that I can pay my aunt back, she helped us in tough times and I'm truly grateful 
		to her.<br> I never try to get my hopes up, I'm the "glass half empty" type of guy. I'm sure after 
		I graduate college my life<br> is going to suck and I'll have to crawl my way up to the food chain, but 
		I don't mind that kind of life.<br> I don't have big ambitions, having food on the table is enough for me
		but that doesn't mean I have to<br> give up on trying; I want my mother and sister to< live freely.
